## Wetlands across timescales

#### JUNE 24th - 26th 2024, GONIĄDZ, POLAND

Organised by the Society of Wetland Scientists - Europe Chapter, Wetlands Conservation Centre (PL), University of Warsaw, Białystok University of Technology, Warsaw University of Life Sciences, Society for the Protection of Habitats “ProHabitat” & The Biebrza National Park.

Scope:\
Time is one of the most important aspects of any ecosystem and is crucial in wetland science. Wetlands develop, fluctuate, degrade and are restored over time. They change from day to day, from season to season and from one geological epoch to another. Time also changes our relationship with wetlands and our approach to their use and conservation. Wetlands, through their ability to store organic matter, are also our window through time and the chronicle of past events. Most of the issues we study in wetlands are time-related. Descriptions of palaeoenvironments, observations of temporal trends and variations of their biotic components, geochemical processes, hydrology or projections of wetland development after restoration or under changing climate are all related to time.
We invite scientists and practitioners from all fields of wetland science and encourage you, if possible, to look at your research through this chrono-perspective.

Welcome to the [Europe Chapter of the Society of Wetland Scientists](https://members.sws.org/europe-chapter). The Europe Chapter was founded to bring together wetland scientists and other European professionals who share common interests in wetland science and management
