There are 50 single rooms, double rooms, triple rooms, and studio suites available at the Bartlowizna Hotel,
where we can accommodate up to 120 people. Due to the small number of single rooms and the large number of participants, 
the conference organizers are responsible for room allocation, and it is not possible to book a room through the hotel reception. 
We also offer ten single and double rooms in the headquarters of the Biebrza National Park in Osowiec-Twierdza - 4 km from the conference venue.
For accommodation, please send information to swseurope24@bagna.pl with information 
about the possibility of accommodation in a double or triple room (friends, colleagues, couples, etc.).

After the allocation of the room, you will be informed about the cost of the hotel stay (it depends on the length of stay andthe standard of the room). Payment for the hotel room should be made at the reception of Bartlowizna Hotel. We prefer to make payment on the day of your stay. It is possible to pay by card or cash. It will also be possible to make a bank transfer to the account of Hotel Bartlowizna in Polish zloty (PLN) currency only. 
At the request of the paying customer will be issued an invoice (personal or institutional) or just a confirmation of payment.
 
We would like to inform you that there are numerous other accommodations available 
(hotels, agritourist lodgings, campgrounds) in GoniÄ…dz and the immediate vicinity. 
Please check the current offer on popular websites, e.g. worldwide - https://booking.com; local - https://e-turysta.com/list-of-accommodation/Goniadz,139958,l,li.html.
