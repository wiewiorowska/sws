{{< text-image-row image="/images/speakers/Viktar Fenchuk.jpeg">}}**Viktar Fenchuk** is a wetland conservationists and wildlife biologist from Belarus. He is a former director of APB-BirdLife Belarus, the country's largest environmental NGO and the leader of the international wilderness conservation programme for APB and the Frankfurt Zoological Society. Viktar was one of the initiators and leaders of several large-scale peatland restoration projects and programmes in Belarus. He was active in establishing effective cooperation between different partners working in wetland conservation and restoration in Belarus and abroad, due to which about every second hectare of restored peatlands in Belarus was restored by or with input from APB. As part of APB and governmental cooperation, he was many times part of Belarus national delegations to UNFCCC and Ramsar Convention meetings and organizer of parallel events promoting peatland restoration and sharing Belarus' experience in rewetting, GHG balance assessment and biodiversity monitoring. Following the 2020 presidential elections in Belarus, Viktar was arrested and sentenced to 2.5 years of imprisonment for participating in peaceful protests. He currently continues to work for the benefit of wetlands in Poland.
