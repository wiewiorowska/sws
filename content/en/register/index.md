You can submit abstracts for oral presentations and/or posters (format max. A0). We welcome abstracts from all wetland-related disciplines and areas of expertise from both scientists and practitioners (academics, consultants and government). The meeting allows wetland scientists and related interests to exchange information and knowledge.

**Abstract format guidelines - see the abstractâ€™s template [here](/abstract.docx).** Abstracts should be submitted in an editable format. 

Abstract submission will open soon. 

**ABSTRACT/POSTER SUBMISSION DEADLINE: March 15th, 2024**

Authors will be notified about abstract acceptance by email at latest two weeks after the submission deadline.

Please note that in case of many submissions, the organising committee may suggest to shift some oral presentations to posters.

SWS will provide two awards for the presentation and the best poster by young scientists.
