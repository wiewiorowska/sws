## (book the date! Registration details soon - check web page for updates)

**It is a 6-day field trip, from June 27th to July 2nd, 2024, through wetland landscapes of NE Poland, with a focus on mires and peatlands.**  During the course, participants will develop and deepen their knowledge of mire ecosystems' functioning, connection to surrounding landscapes, specific biodiversity, and ecosystem services. We will visit the last well-preserved bogs and fens of various ecological and hydrogenetic types, as well as degraded peatlands, trying to identify the causes and consequences of environmental deterioration. At each site, we will discuss conservation approaches, assess the effectiveness of so-far applied measures, and consider possible alternatives, look at synergies and constraints between nature conservation and other land uses in and around wetlands. Last but not least, we will meet people responsible for wetland management and restoration, discussing the social, economic, and political dimensions of conservation and restoration. 
We warmly invite you to join us on this adventure, contributing to the success of this summer school by sharing your knowledge while discussing specific problems in the beautiful scenery of NE-Polish wetlands.

**For whom?**\
We dedicate the Wetland Summer School to practitioners and researchers in the field of wetland  conservation and restoration who have (or can have in the future) a significant impact on the condition of these ecosystems. Staff members of non-governmental organisations and nature conservation administration, scientists and PhD students are welcome. To facilitate good internal communication and logistics, the number of participants is limited to 23 persons (plus staff). 

**What will be the scope of the training?**\
Understanding the functioning and status of wetlands and planning their protection or restoration is an eminently interdisciplinary task. Since it is not always possible to consult various specialists, you need a broad competence in many fields. Therefore, we include in the course agenda the aspects of botany and vegetation ecology, soil and peat science, ecohydrology, landscape ecology, ornithology, methods of ecosystem services assessment, and practice of planning and implementation of ecosystem management and restoration.

**What can you expect?**\
The course will have a formula of a 6-day-long tour through various peatlands of Podlasie (with the addition of Mazovia). We will visit, among others, the Rospuda Valley and other peatlands of the Augustów Primeval Forest, Biebrza National Park, the Narew National Park, the area around the Białowieża Primeval Forest, to end our route at the Bagno Całowanie near Warsaw. 
We will travel by bus. arranging accommodation in several tourist facilities. 
We will mainly spend time in the field, exploring different aspects of the diversity of wetland ecosystems, understanding their degradation processes, gaining knowledge about research methods, conducting conservation activities, and evaluating their results. We assume that the aim of the School is not only to impart knowledge unilaterally but first and foremost, to network and exchange knowledge and experience with all participants. During the evenings we will have time for short lectures and discussions . At the end, we are planning a short seminar where the School participants will present their activities (projects, research, legal issues, etc.) related to wetlands.

**Who will lead the School?**\
The Summer School is organised by the Wetland Conservation Centre (PL). Dr. Łukasz Kozub and Dr. Wiktor Kotowski, as well as guest experts connected to SWS-Europe (see updates on this soon), will lead the course.

**How much does it cost?**\
The actual fee for participation in the School is still not known as we are waiting for a decision from potential sponsors to cover part of the costs. The maximum cost per person is around 1200 EUR but we hope to substantially lower it based on the submitted grant application. The actual fee will be announced soon, together with the registration announcement.

**How to apply?**\
We will launch registration soon (in the beginning of March).  You will be asked to provide a brief CV and description of how your work or other activities are related to wetlands, as well as how you intend to use the acquired knowledge. The potential for "multiplication" of the project's effects is an important criterion for its evaluation and will also be important in ranking candidates for the School. In the application, you will also be asked to propose a topic for your speech during the School's final mini-conference. The registration will be opened from April 24th to May 10th. We will select participants by May 20th.
